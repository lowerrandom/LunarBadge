# Lunar Lander Badge Team Projects

![BadgeSAO](/images/withSAO.png "Lunar Lander Badge with SAO attached")

The Lunar Lander Badge team have two projects for DEF CON 27: a [badge](https://github.com/lunarbadge/LunarBadgeDC27) featuring a Lunar Lander game and some puzzles, and a [SAO](https://github.com/lunarbadge/LunarLanderSAO) with some flashing LEDs.  The SAO is a lunar lander that docks with the badge using a SAO 1.69bis compatible connection.

We chose the theme to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing, Apollo 11 in July 1969.  We look back at the Apollo missions as a time of optimism for engineers and scientists working to build technology's promise (DEF CON 27 theme).
